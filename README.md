### How To Buy:

The way that you can buy these prints is by contacting me through either my phone number, which is at the bottom of the page, or you can find me at my locker at the end of the day. Be prepared with the print you want and the payment, and I will try to get your print back to you as quickly as possible. I will update this page if I am out of town at any time, so you can know.

### Info:
My name is James Wiseman, I own a Ender 3 S1 Pro 3D printer. The best way you can contact me is by messaging me which print you would like to purchase. My phone number is 989-948-5266, but if you would like to contact me through real life I will be at my locker after/before most days, or, I will be in room 404 after school on tuesday's because I have art club.
